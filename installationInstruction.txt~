This package is a biblatex style for the Maltese journal "Xjenza". The
style is based on the APA (American Psychological Association) style,
currently maintained by Philip Kime (Â© 2013).

It implements a citation style (xjenza.cbx) and a references section style
(xjenza.bbx). The styles are loaded just like any other biblatex
styles but I wouldn't try to use the citation and references styles
separately as they rely on each other, macro-wise, in places.

You will need to be using csquotes >= 4.3 and biblatex >= 2.0 The biber
backend for biblatex >= 1.0 is also required. This style will not work
correctly if using bibtex as the backend for biblatex.

Installation

	- Make sure you have
		biblatex: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex
		Windows (miktex): check if they are installed from the MiKTeX2.9>Maintenance (Admin)>MiKTeX Package Manager
	  and
		biber: http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/
		Windows (miktex): check if they are installed from the MiKTeX2.9>Maintenance (Admin)>MiKTeX Package Manager
	  installed on your system.

	- Move the "biblatex-xjenza" folder to the appropriate texmf directory, such as

		Linux: /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/
		Mac: /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/tex/latex
		Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex

	  (A good way to find the approprate directory is to locat the folder "biblatex-apa".
	  "biblatex-xjenza" must be in the same directory)

	- Update with
		Linux: sudo texhash
		Mac: sudo texhash
		Windows: Open MiKTeX2.9>Maintenance (Admin)>Settings (Admin) and click Refresh FNDB

Execution

	- The pdf is generated in the usuall way using PDFLaTeX.

	- To generate the reference section execute biber from terminal
		> biber paper
	  after having already executed PDFLaTeX. This should be followed by another PDFLaTeX
	  If you are using texmaker, you can add the command
		biber %|pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex|evince %.pdf
	  to the
		> Options > Configure TexMaker > Quick Build tab
	  to execute these commands.
