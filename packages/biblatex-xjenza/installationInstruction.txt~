This package is a biblatex style for the Maltese journal "Xjenza". The
style is based on the APA (American Psychological Association) style,
currently maintained by Philip Kime (Â© 2013).

It implements a citation style (xjenza.cbx) and a references section style
(xjenza.bbx). The styles are loaded just like any other biblatex
styles but I wouldn't try to use the citation and references styles
separately as they rely on each other, macro-wise, in places.

You will need to be using csquotes >= 4.3 and biblatex >= 2.0 The biber
backend for biblatex >= 1.0 is also required. This style will not work
correctly if using bibtex as the backend for biblatex.

Installation

	- Make sure you have biblatex installed on your system.

	- Move the "biblatex-xjenza" folder to the appropriate texmf directory, such as
		Linux: /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/
		Mac: /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/tex/latex
	(A good way to find the approprate directory is to locat the folder "biblatex-apa".
	"biblatex-xjenza" must be in the same directory)

	- Update with
		Linux: sudo texhash
		Mac: sudo texhash

Execution

	- The pdf is generated in the usuall way using PDFLaTeX.

	- To generate the reference section execute biber
		> biber paper
	  after having already executed PDFLaTeX. This should be followed by another PDFLaTeX
