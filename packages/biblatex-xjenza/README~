This package is a biblatex style for the Maltese journal "Xjenza". The
style is based on the APA (American Psychological Association) style,
currently maintained by Philip Kime (Â© 2013).

It implements a citation style (xjenza.cbx) and a references section style
(xjenza.bbx). The styles are loaded just like any other biblatex
styles but I wouldn't try to use the citation and references styles
separately as they rely on each other, macro-wise, in places.

You will need to be using csquotes >= 4.3 and biblatex >= 2.0 The biber
backend for biblatex >= 1.0 is also required. This style will not work
correctly if using bibtex as the backend for biblatex.
